# letterAnimation
Figured out a sweet letter animation that I'd like to share with everyone.

Below you'll see a demo of the animation.

# Usage

Simply go into the files in this repo and copy/paste the JS and CSS.
The animation will target any letters with the classname "letter". 
I've been using it as a hero intro animation, therefore the useEffect when the hero is mounted.
